      <h1>Finance</h1>
      <p>
        After securing an initial development fund by a private financial backer, the budgeting of overheads against
        variable expenditures needed to be maintained throughout during the project’s progress. Our own company finance
        manager would assess the total expenditures at the end of each week to see if restrictions needed to be
        tightened or eased. Each iteration would line up in conjunction with a set wage budget based on the assigned
        user stories time estimates. A summary of the project’s finances during its development can be seen in the
        ‘TutorPoint Financial Summary Report’.

        The CUBIXEL company vision and mission statement was utilised by the CUBIXEL marketing team
        to direct marketing initiatives and actions during the development process for the TutorPoint product. The vision and
        mission statement additionally enabled the CUBIXEL marketing team to monitor the success of marketing initiatives
        in regard to their conformity with the CUBIXEL vision and mission statement and their contribution to achieving
        marketing targets. A diagram illustrating the CUBIXEL mission statement, strategy and values can be seen below,
        detailing what CUBIXEL consideres important regarding our customers, colleagues, and community.

      <p>
        The CUBIXEL marketing team undertook extensive analysis of the TutorPoint product being developed by CUBIXEL,
        such analysis consisted of an overview and examination of the relative strengths, weaknesses, opportunities
        and threats possessed by TutorPoint. Identifying and acknowledging such aspects of the CUBIXEL company and TutorPoint
        enables for us to act upon our strengths, ensuring that we are always working effectively and efficiently;
        identifying weaknesses allows us to utilise our strengths to mitigate their effects and improve as a company;
        highlighting opportunities for the TutorPoint product enables CUBIXEL to capitalise on them, hence, paving the way
        for TutorPoint to grow as a brand and product within its market; finally, identifying threats to the
        TutorPoint brand and product enables us to prepare for potential problematic factors, threats cannot be
        controlled, however, they're effects can be mitigated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CUBIXEL marketing team carried substantial research into the market context in which the TutorPoint product
        resides, that being, private and online education. By understanding market trends in the industry associated
        industries, CUBIXEL was able to take advantage of opportunities as they arise and act quickly to reduce any risks to
        development or deployment of the product. To achieve such research, primary and secondary market research
        methods were utilised. Utilising secondary research methods involved seeking out existing research and
        data sources applicable to TutorPoint's industry. A majority of secondary sources were  sourced from the
        internet; examples including demographics and market research compiled by similar companies and products, and
        reports issued by research institutions. In the case where secondary research methods produced
        insufficient data, primary research methods were utilised, carried out personally by the CUBIXEL marketing team;
        the predominant method that was used was online surveys.
