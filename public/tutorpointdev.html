        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p>
          Believe it or not, the TutorPoint product, and the features that it offers its user, did not
          manifest out of thin air. From the very beginning, to what it is today, TutorPoint has undergone an
          extensive development process, comprising of hundreds of hours of designing, programming and testing;
          all of which would not have been impossible without the dedication and determination of the CUBIXEL team.
        </p>
        <p>
          TutorPoint was first conceived out of the discussion of products that would meet the specification
          and criteria set by our client. Such discussion gave rise to a variety of candidates
          for potential projects that CUBIXEL could engage in; suggested ideas included an interactive
          mobile phone repair manual, a multi-media flash card application, and an art work gallery
          social media application, just to name a few. Despite a large number of potential candidates, three
          ideas were favourable amongst team members. Product number one was an interactive PDF-like application
          specifically designed for practical lab work, offering check-lists, progress bars, and instructional videos.
          Product number two was an information tracker for the game 'Dungeons & Dragons', designed to help aid
          the ‘Dungeon Master’ in controlling player stats and locations, also incorporating
          an embedded digital dice. The third and final product was an online tutoring application
          incorporating a range of online topics with multimedia abilities such as video chat, text chat,
          and screen editing with the intent for educational purposes.

          and compared their features and functionalities.

        </div>
        <p>
          Through much deliberation between team members and consultation with our client, the CUBIXEL team
          came to a unanimous decision to dedicate to the development of an online tutoring application. This application
          was proposed to offer a one-to-one and one-to-many steaming platform for live tuition sessions, during which,
          users would have access to a webcam, an XML file display, a digital whiteboard and other features with the purpose
          to supplement education.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subsequent task that was undertaken in the development process was the design and creation of
          the product branding; this included the product name, its logo and its colour scheme. Such components of a
          product are significant to its success, in regards to development and marketing. Examples of some of the
          proposed logo designs and names can be seen below.
        </p>
        <div class="row" style="padding: 0 0 20px 0;">
          <div class="column">
            <img class="card" style="object-fit: scale-down; width: 90%; height: 107.5%; cursor: default" src="resources/img/tutorpointdev/tutorme.jpg">
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img class="card" style="object-fit: scale-down; width: 90%; height: 50%; cursor: default" src="resources/img/tutorpointdev/tp.jpg">
            <img class="card" style="object-fit: scale-down; width: 90%; height: 50%; cursor: default" src="resources/img/tutorpointdev/global.jpg">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Despite the various candidates for our product branding, one was chosen that best conveyed what we
          wanted our product to represent and its purpose. The name TutorPoint was the successful candidate; though
          a simple name, it states clearly the industry in which the product is associated with whilst also inferring
          the product's purpose as a platform for tutors. The logo that was chosen depicts a tutor-like figure, as
          represented by the mortarboard, ahead of two smaller figures which represent students; this design feature
          portrays a tutor offering guidance to students, the core purpose of our product. This illustation is
          contained within a pin-drop shape, often used in maps to display a location, hence representing that our
          product is a location in which one can receive tutoring services. The final product branding design can be
          seen below.
