HTML Tour
You are to construct an HTML-based tour of your product and associated documentation. During the marking
procedure at the end of the project your first supervisor will show an overview of your groupâ€™s work to all
other supervisors. To aid them in this task, you are to put together a series of HTML pages that explain what
your group has done and how it has worked, highlighting (and providing links to) the appropriate documents.
You should ensure that all available documentation on the memory stick is clearly linked from the tour and of
the appropriate format.
